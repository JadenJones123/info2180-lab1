            My name is Jaden Jones. I'm a third-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Economics. 
            I would consider myself computer literate as well as enjoying PC games and watching movies. 
            I'm interested in web development because I was curious as to what itâ€™s like to fully develop 
            a website using creative and technical skills. Additionally, I was interested in using HTML, CSS, 
            and JavaScript so this is the perfect opportunity and environment to learn these skills.
